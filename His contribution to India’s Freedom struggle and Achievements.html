                <p>Back in India, in the year of 1919, the British started to arrest and imprison anyone they suspect of
                    sedition that’s when Gandhi stood up and started non-violent disobedience. Gandhi’s goal about
                    Indian’s independence got cleared after a tragic incident when more than 20000 protesters were
                    getting open fired by the British army in the city of Amritsar.</p>

                <p>400 people were killed and 1000 injured. He started the mass boycotts of British goods and
                    institutions and told everyone to stop working for the British. In 1992 he was again got arrested
                    and got a 6-year prison sentence. In 1930 he started the salt march and a very well known campaign
                    of walking 390km to the Arabian Sea shores.</p>

                <p>The salt act protesters around 60,000 including Gandhi were imprisoned. At the time of World War II,
                    Gandhi started his campaign if Quit India to banish British rule from the country, he was again
                    arrested and sent to prison with many other well-known leaders of Indian Congress. He met King
                    George V on behalf of the Indian National Congress, but there was not that much progress.</p>
                    
                <p>After the End of the war, Britain’s government was changed and this time progress was made they were
                    willing to discuss independence for India but a tragic event followed by it partition of the country
                    into India and Pakistan. In 1947 India gained independence. In the year of 1948, a Hindu extremist
                    killed Gandhi. In this essay on Mahatma Gandhi, learn about the contributions made by Mahatma
                    Gandhi!</p>
