            <div class="text-center know-text">
                <p>Very little can be said concerning his life. Scholars generally place him in South India during the
                    2nd century CE. Traditional accounts state that he lived 400 years after the Buddha passed into
                    nirvana (c. 5th–4th century BCE). Some biographies also state, however, that he lived for 600 years,
                    apparently identifying him with a second Nagarjuna known for his Tantric (esoteric) writings. Two of
                    the works attributed to Nagarjuna are verses of advice to a king, which suggests that he achieved
                    some fame during his lifetime. Other sources indicate that he also served as abbot of a monastery
                    and that he was the teacher of Aryadeva, the author of important Madhyamika texts. Numerous
                    commentaries on Nagarjuna’s works were composed in India, China, and Tibet.</p>

                <p>Although he is best known in the West for his writings on emptiness, especially as set forth in his most famous work, the Mulamadhyamakakarika (“Fundamental Verses on the Middle Way”), Nagarjuna wrote many other works on a wide range of topics (even when questions of attribution are taken into account). It is only from a broad assessment of these works that an adequate understanding of his thought can be gained.</p>

                <p>Despite his monastic background, Nagarjuna addressed his works to a variety of audiences. His philosophical texts were sometimes directed against logicians of non-Buddhist schools, but most often they offered critiques of the doctrines and assumptions of the non-Mahayana Buddhist schools, especially the Sarvastivada (literally, “Asserting Everything That Exists”). Nagarjuna’s overriding theme, however, is the bodhisattva’s path to buddhahood and the merit and wisdom that the bodhisattva must accumulate in order to achieve enlightenment. By wisdom, Nagarjuna meant the perfection of wisdom, declared in the sutras to be the knowledge of emptiness. Nagarjuna is credited with transforming the sutras’ poetic and sometimes paradoxical declarations on emptiness into a philosophical system.</p>
