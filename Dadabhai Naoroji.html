            <div class="text-center know-text">
                <p>He was a member of Parliament in the Parliament of the United Kingdom between 1892 and 1895, and the
                    first Asian to be a British MP.Dadabhai was born on September 4, 1825, to a poor Parsi family in
                    Mumbai. His father, Naoroji Palanji Dordi, died when Dadabhai was only four years old.He was brought
                    up by his illiterate mother, Maneckbai who gave Dadabhai the best possible English education.</p>

                <p>As a student, he had a knack for mental Mathematics and went on to distinguish himself in Mathematics
                    and English at the Elphinstone Institution (now a college) in Mumbai.</p>

                <p>So inspired were his associates that one teacher considered him the “guarantee of India.” Another
                    offered to pay a large portion of the costs for Dadabhai to think about abroad.His Parsi elders refused to pay the other half of the expenses out of fear that Dadabhai would
                    convert to Christianity and marry an English woman.
                </p>

                <p>On completion of his education, Dadabhai was appointed the Head Native Assistant Master at the
                    Elphinstone Institution and went on to become the first Indian professor of Mathematics and Natural
                    Philosophy.Dadabhai entered the political fray in 1852. The East India Company procured a 20-year rent to
                    “oversee” India from the British Government in 1833. The company applied for renewal of the lease in
                    1853.
                </p>


                <p>Dadabhai strongly opposed the renewal of the lease and organized large meetings and sent petitions to
                    the British government in England to deny the company a renewal.</p>
