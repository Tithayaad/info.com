            <div class="text-center know-text">
                <p>Swami Dayananda Saraswati, known as Mulshankar in the childhood, was born in 1824 in a small town of
                    Tankara belonging to Kathiawar of Gujarat in a conservative Brahmin family.</p>

                <p>Taking early education from his family, he subsequently emerged as a great Vedic scholar. He
                    renunciated the worldly life and moved from one part of India to another in the pursuit of wisdom
                    and truth.</p>

                <p>Finally, he met Swami Vrajanand at Mathura and became his disciple. After completing his education,
                    he went on with the mission of spreading true Hindu religion and culture all over India. With this
                    purpose he established the Arya Samaj at Bombay on 10th April, 1875. A number of twenty eight rules
                    were framed which were approved by the members present in the meeting. As a writer of eminence,
                    Dayananda wrote books like ‘Satyarth Prakash’, Vedanga Prakash, ‘Ratnamala’ ‘Sankarvidhi’,
                    ‘Bharatinivarna’ etc. He travelled throughout the country to propagate his views and established
                    branches of Arya Samaj at different places.</p>
